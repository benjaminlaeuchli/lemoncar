Auto Dealership Kick Prediction Model
Description

One of the biggest challenges faced by auto dealerships when purchasing used cars at auctions is the risk that the vehicle might have serious issues, making it unsellable to customers. These problematic vehicles, known as "kicks," can result from tampered odometers, hidden mechanical issues, title transfer difficulties, or other unforeseen problems. The financial impact of kicks on dealerships can be significant, involving high transportation costs, unnecessary repair work, and market losses when attempting to resell the vehicle.

The goal of this project is to predict whether a car purchased at an auto auction will be a kick (i.e., a bad buy). By identifying high-risk vehicles before they are purchased, dealerships can avoid costly mistakes, improve inventory selection, and offer better cars to customers.

Objective
The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a vehicle bought at an auction will be a kick or not, helping auto dealerships make informed purchasing decisions. The model should be able to predict the likelihood of a car having issues that would make it difficult to sell, allowing dealers to avoid vehicles that are likely to become a financial burden.
